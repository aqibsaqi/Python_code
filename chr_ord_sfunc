In Python, chr() and ord() are built-in functions that convert between characters and their Unicode code points:
ord(char)
Purpose: Converts a single character to its Unicode integer code.

Input: A single character (string of length 1).

Output: An integer representing the Unicode code point of the character.

chr(code)
Purpose: Converts a Unicode integer code to its corresponding character.

Input: An integer (valid Unicode code point).

Output: A string of length 1 (the character).

Common Use Case:
Converting letters to numbers and back (e.g., Caesar cipher or custom encryption).
