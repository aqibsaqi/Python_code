Bank Account System:
Create a system where different types of bank accounts (like savings and checking) allow operations like deposit, withdraw, and checking balance — securely and with clean structure.

tep-by-Step: OOP Concepts in Action
1. Encapsulation
Protect account balance — don't let users directly change it.

 2. Abstraction
User interacts with simple methods like deposit() or withdraw(), not with the internal math or data validation.

 3. Inheritance
Different account types (SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount) inherit from a common BankAccount class.

 4. Polymorphism
Each account type can have its own version of withdraw()
